# Huffman Coding Algorithm

Huffman Coding is an algorithm for encryption of text and decryption based on Huffman Tree.

## Requirements

* Numpy

## Discription

The first input is the text and the algorithm will create a tree and encrypt text based on it.

The Huffman Tree is shown in a matrix which is equivalent in reverse measurement, it means the letter that repeated less than the others are in first line of matrix (which is the last branch of the huffman tree).

After encryption we can decrypt codes (zero and one) based on the huffman tree to get the decrypted text.
